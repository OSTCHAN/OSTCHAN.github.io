Vector Subtraction
------

Suddenly, it occurred to me that $\vec{a} - \vec{b}$ can be understood as $\text{a} - \text{b}$:

I.e. you can easily take vector subtraction as point subtraction:

From the very beginning, i have always understood (~~or "memorized"~~) vector subtraction as the former, without thinking it via point's perspective even once. Therefore, it's necessary to get down.

Before my realization of it, regarding the result of $\vec{a} - \vec{b}$, the way of my memorization has always been like: the result vector is the vector pointing at end/tip of the subtracted vector($\vec{a}$) from end/tip of the subtractor vector($\vec{b}$).

> From the very beginning, I have always understood (~~or "memorized"~~) vector subtraction as the former, without ever considering it from the perspective of the points. Therefore, it is necessary to make a note of it.

> Prior to my realization, regarding the result of $\vec{a} - \vec{b}$, I have always memorized it as follows: the resulting vector points from the end/tip of the subtracted vector ($\vec{a}$) to the end/tip of the subtractor vector ($\vec{b}$).
